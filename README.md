# btest ... A minimal test framework

A minimal test framework.

This framework has been extracted from [TeFLL](https://github.com/davidg238/fuzzy_logic) and is now better aligned with the semantics of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
Originally developed to support a quick port of the tests for [eFLL](https://github.com/zerokol/eFLL).
