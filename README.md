# btest ... A minimal test framework

This is a minimal test framework, extracted from [TeFLL](https://github.com/davidg238/fuzzy_logic) and now better aligned with the semantics of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).  
Originally developed to support a quick port of the tests for [eFLL](https://github.com/zerokol/eFLL).
